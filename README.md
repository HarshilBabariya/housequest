# HomeQuest

Gamified household expense manager for Android. Log day-to-day spending, split it with family or friends, keep budgets, and earn points that unlock themes, avatar outfits and features.

- Native Android · Kotlin · Jetpack Compose · Material 3
- Local-first: Room database + DataStore, no backend or account required
- minSdk 26 · targetSdk 35

## Build

Open the folder in Android Studio (Ladybug or newer) and run the `app` configuration, or from a terminal with the Android SDK installed:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

The repo ships without a Gradle wrapper binary; Android Studio generates one, or run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.9` once.

## Get an APK without a local setup

Push this folder to a GitHub repository (branch `main`). The included workflow `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` builds a debug APK on every push; download it from the run's **Artifacts** section under Actions, copy it to the phone and install (allow "unknown sources" when prompted).
